                    Argentina or the <em>Argentine Republic</em> is located in the very Southern 
                    tip of South America, a fact that influenced its history and development.
                    It was conquered and populated by Spain in the 1500s mainly around the 
                    Rio de la Plata area where <a href="index.html#capital">Buenos Aires</a>, the 
                    present capital, was founded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first attempt for independence occurred on May 25, 1810 with the 
                    formation of the first Argentine government in Buenos Aires. Full 
                    independence as a republic was declared on July 9, 1816 in the northern 
                    province of Tucumán after many efforts from Spain to maintain its colonies.
                    Many heroes resulted from this fight with the most known being General José 
                    de San Martín (who with Simon Bolivar liberated most of South America) and 
                    Manuel Belgrano, the creator of the flag and great defender of liberty. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Spanish</strong> remained as the official language. Political problems 
                    made progress difficult, but the best era of advancement has been from the late 
                    1800s to mid-1900s when a large amount of European immigration took place mainly 
                    from Spain, Italy, and other countries constituting a "melting pot" of culture, 
                    tradition, and desire to succeed in a generous country with an excellent 
                    climate, geography, and open arms. This, in addition to the immigrant's work, 
                    made possible the great production of grains, cattle, and beef industry while 
                    at the same time exporting its richness around the world. It also included 
                    minery, wood, metallurgy, and manufacturing of goods among many products.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of the 45 million inhabitants are descendants of these immigrants and 
                    the mix with indigenous and other races. There was never a full practice of 
                    slavery which was only represented by a small number of domestic help. This 
                    continued in many owner's homes even after freedom was declared. The mix of 
                    races brought much folk and tradition in different parts of the country, 
                    fútbol, tango dances, asado, and many others that are some expressions of the 
                    culture. This also includes a 99% literacy, providing several famous scientists, 
                    writers, painters, doctors, Noble prizes etc., but failing to provide complete 
                    political stability for growing to its full potential.
