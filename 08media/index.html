                Argentina or the <em>Argentine Republic</em> is located in the very Southern
                tip of South America, a fact that influenced its history and development.
                It was conquered and populated by Spain in the 1500s mainly around the
                Rio de la Plata area where <a href="index.html#capital">Buenos Aires</a>, the
                present capital, was founded.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first attempt for independence occurred on May 25, 1810 with the
                formation of the first Argentine government in Buenos Aires. Full
                independence as a republic was declared on July 9, 1816 in the northern
                province of Tucumán after many efforts from Spain to maintain its colonies.
                Many heroes resulted from this fight with the most known being General José
                de San Martín (who with Simon Bolivar liberated most of South America) and
                Manuel Belgrano, the creator of the flag and great defender of liberty.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Spanish</strong> remained as the official language. Political problems
                made progress difficult, but the best era of advancement has been from the late
                1800s to mid-1900s when a large amount of European immigration took place mainly
                from Spain, Italy, and other countries constituting a "melting pot" of culture,
                tradition, and desire to succeed in a generous country with an excellent
                climate, geography, and open arms. This, in addition to the immigrant's work,
                made possible the great production of grains, cattle, and beef industry while
                at the same time exporting its richness around the world. It also included
                minery, wood, metallurgy, and manufacturing of goods among many products.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of the 45 million inhabitants are descendants of these immigrants and
                the mix with indigenous and other races. There was never a full practice of
                slavery which was only represented by a small number of domestic help. This
                continued in many owner's homes even after freedom was declared. The mix of
                races brought much folk and tradition in different parts of the country,
                fútbol, tango dances, asado, and many others that are some expressions of the
                culture. This also includes a 99% literacy, providing several famous scientists,
                writers, painters, doctors, Noble prizes etc., but failing to provide complete
                political stability for growing to its full potential.
